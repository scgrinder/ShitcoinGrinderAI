## Architecture

SCGrinderAI+ follows a client-server architecture with the addition of a source component.

- **Server**: The server is where clients connect. Clients wait for signals from the server and execute them.
- **Client**: The client is an open-source component, and contributions from the community are welcome.
- **Source**: The source is a proprietary service that analyzes every transaction on the ETH and BSC blockchains to find high-potential tokens. It continuously monitors their behavior and sends signals to the server when a token shows significant potential.

## Black Swan Strategy

The black swan strategy is a powerful investment approach employed by SCGrinderAI+. It suggests investing a small percentage of your portfolio in high-risk investments, such as shitcoins. By buying a wide range of tokens recognized by the AI model, the strategy aims to capture the significant growth potential of a few tokens, which can outweigh any previous losses.
