## Software Architecture

The SCGrinderAI+ software consists of three key components: the Server, the Client, and the Source.

### Server
The Server acts as the central hub where clients connect. Clients establish a connection with the server and wait for signals to be received. The server is responsible for broadcasting signals to all connected clients, enabling them to execute the specified actions.

### Client
The Client component is an open-source application that allows users to connect to the SCGrinderAI+ server. It serves as the interface for receiving signals from the server and executing the corresponding actions. The Client software is open for contributions, welcoming developers to contribute to its continuous improvement.

### Source
The Source component is a proprietary service that plays a crucial role in the SCGrinderAI+ ecosystem. It leverages advanced AI-trained models to analyze every transaction on the Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchains. The Source continuously monitors the deployment of new tokens and identifies high-potential tokens at an early stage.

When a new token is deployed, the Source starts monitoring its behavior to assess its growth potential. Once a token demonstrates significant potential, the Source sends a signal to the server. This signal contains vital information about the token and its potential. The server then broadcasts this signal to all connected clients, enabling them to take action based on the provided insights.

By leveraging the power of the Source's AI-trained models and real-time monitoring, SCGrinderAI+ ensures that clients receive timely and accurate signals, allowing them to capitalize on high-potential token opportunities in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Note: The Source component is a proprietary service and not open source, as it involves proprietary AI models and advanced monitoring techniques.

Please note that the above description is a general overview of the software architecture and can be further expanded or customized based on the specific implementation and features of SCGrinderAI+.
