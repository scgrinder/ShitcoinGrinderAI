  - Open a terminal.
  - Run the following command to download the `get-pip.py` script:
    ```
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    ```

  - Open a command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the script, and run the command: `python get-pip.py`


## Getting Started

1. Clone the SCGrinderAI+ repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/JediKunnow/ShitcoinGrinderAI</code>
2. Rename the configuration file from <code>settings.ini.example</code> to <code>settings.ini</code>.
3. Paste private key and api key in the configuration file (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
4. Install requirements (see [Installing requirements](#installing-requirements))
5. Start the client with <code>python3 client.py</code>

### Installing requirements

To install the required packages for SCGrinderAI+, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

The configuration file looks like that:

<code>
    [Account]
    private_key = 'your_private_key'
    auth_token = 'your_api_key'

    [Source]
    host = app.shitcoingrinder.xyz
    port = 8081

    [Network]
    #Â BSC=56 | ETH=1
    id = 56
    rpc = https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org/

    [Trading]
    # this is your max trade size expressed in percentage.
    # Eg: 30 = 30% of the USDT in your wallet.
    max_trade_size = 30
    # Max lifetime of an open position, expressed in days.
    position_max_lifetime = 30
    # Take profit in %
    take_profit = 200
    # Position check interval, in minutes
    check_interval = 5
</code>

Let's describe further some parameters:
- <code>private_key</code>: your wallet private key. It's stored on your computer and it won't be sent to anyone.
- <code>auth_token</code>: it's your apikey. You can find it in the [dashboard](https://app.shitcoingrinder.xyz/dashboard) 
- <code>max_trade_size</code>: The maximum size of a trade your are intended to do, expressed in percentage of the total amount of USDT in your wallet. If you have 1000 USDT in your wallet and this parameter is set to 10, the maximum trade size for you will be 100 USDT. We advice to keep this value between 5 and 30%.
- <code>take_profit</code>: Everytime you'll recieve a signal you'll open a position. This parameter means when to close the position and take the profit. If set to 200 it means a 2x.
- <code>position_max_lifetime</code>: If a position doesn't hit the tp treeshold it will expire instead of remaing open forever. Set this value here expressed in days. If this parameter is set to 30, positions will be automatically closed after 30 days if the tp isn't reached before.
- <code>check_interval</code>: The position status is checked periodically, default is every 5 minutes. Here you can set a custom value for that, but we strongly advice to don't set a value lower than 5 minutes, or the RPC might get overloaded.

## Architecture

SCGrinderAI+ follows a client-server architecture with the addition of a source component.

- **Server**: The server is where clients connect. Clients wait for signals from the server and execute them.
- **Client**: The client is an open-source component, and contributions from the community are welcome.
- **Source**: The source is a proprietary service that analyzes every transaction on the ETH and BSC blockchains to find high-potential tokens. It continuously monitors their behavior and sends signals to the server when a token shows significant potential.

## Black Swan Strategy

The black swan strategy is a powerful investment approach employed by SCGrinderAI+. It suggests investing a small percentage of your portfolio in high-risk investments, such as shitcoins. By buying a wide range of tokens recognized by the AI model, the strategy aims to capture the significant growth potential of a few tokens, which can outweigh any previous losses.

## License

The SCGrinderAI+ software is released under the [SCGrinderAI+ License](LICENSE). The client component is open-source and subject to the terms of the [Open Source License](LICENSE.client).
